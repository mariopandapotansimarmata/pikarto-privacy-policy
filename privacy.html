  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Pikarto (“we,” “our,” or “the App”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microphone Input:</strong> We use your device’s microphone to capture your voice during practice sessions.</li>
    <li><strong>Transcripts & Evaluations:</strong> Audio recordings are sent to third-party APIs (OpenAI for transcription and Gemini API for evaluation). The resulting text transcripts and evaluation feedback are stored locally on your device for learning history.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transcription:</strong> Your voice input is processed by OpenAI’s API to generate a text transcript.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The transcript is sent to Gemini API to provide feedback on Structure, Effectiveness, and Relevance.</li>
    <li><strong>Learning History:</strong> Only the transcript and evaluation results are stored locally on your device to help track your progress.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Audio Data:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> store or retain your audio recordings.</li>
    <li><strong>Transcripts & Evaluations:</strong> These are stored locally on your device only. You may delete them anytime by clearing the app’s data.</li>
    <li><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> We do not upload or store your personal data on our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, share, or disclose your personal data to third parties. The only data transmitted externally is your audio (for transcription) and transcript (for evaluation), which are processed securely by trusted third-party APIs (OpenAI and Gemini).</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. However, since we rely on third-party APIs, their privacy practices also apply when processing your data. Please review OpenAI’s and Gemini’s privacy policies for more details.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can delete your transcripts and evaluation history at any time.</li>
    <li>You may also uninstall the app to remove all stored information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with a new “Effective Date.”</p>
